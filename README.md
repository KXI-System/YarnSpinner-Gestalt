# YarnSpinner Gestalt

WIP project to add YarnSpinner integration and support to Godot.

Has the following features:
- Importers for `.yarn` and `.yarnc` filetypes
- Importers to handle compiled string tables/lines and line metadata csv files
- Resource type to handle precompiled yarn files in a yarn project-like way
- Resource file that's cosplaying as a yarn project but doesn't do anything
